# Simple ingenuous run-length encoding on Haskell language

The application has such an interface: ./[compilled main.hs] input.txt [commpress/decompress] output.txt <br>
Then input.txt will be commpressed/decompressed into output.txt

Usage example:
```shell
./rle input.txt commpress output.txt
```
